# SimCity Radio [FORK - simplified]

I forked the Original mod [SimCity Radio](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/76446/Windows) because it wasn't working anymore,
simplified (in my eyes, also dumbified) the code, removed the ads and returned to the default config ways as described here: [ExtendedRadio](https://github.com/AlphaGaming7780/ExtendedRadio/wiki/Custom-Radio)

## Notes

Detailed information on the [SimCity 3000](https://www.discogs.com/release/5394990-Various-SimCity-3000),
